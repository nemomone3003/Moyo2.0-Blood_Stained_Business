		<baseDesc>To become a Siren, the most famous celebrity in the Lighthouse, one must literally make bone-crushing efforts. There must be no external flaws, and one must have an innate talent for the arts. Therefore, it is difficult even to attempt this unless one is from the lower echelons of the Lighthouse. {PAWN_nameDef} has lived under strict supervision as a Siren candidate and has proven {PAWN_possessive} abilities. However, becoming a Siren requires more than just proving oneself. Hope the path {PAWN_pronoun} takes in the future be a worthwhile one.</baseDesc>

But the Council changed its attitude as easily as flipping a hand, and {PAWN_pronoun} had all {PAWN_possessive} possessions seized. Now, {PAWN_nameDef} has decided to place {PAWN_possessive} last hope in the surface world.</baseDesc>
